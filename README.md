Toolsuit to model collision of Planet systems

The currently used algorithm for inclined orbits is imprecise - specifically, the formula to derive direction vectors is only accurate with low inclinations.

Results might be off under *very* close approaches when the steps of the iteration become too large to accurately capture the dynamics. Also, direct collisions cannot currently be modelled, when that happens objects will appear to move through each other.
